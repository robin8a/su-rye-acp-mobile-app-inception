```

# Git 
```sh

git remote add origin ssh://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/suRyeAcpMobileApp
git remote -v

# origin  ssh://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/suRyeAcpMobileApp (fetch)

# AWS Profile

```sh
less ~/.aws/config


# [profile su-rye-acp]

## Linux or macOS

export AWS_PROFILE=su-rye-acp

```


# Testing

```sh
cd suRyeAcpMobileApp
npm start # you can also use: expo start
expo start

```
